# piprojects4libraries
Here you'll find a collection of Raspberry Pi Projects for use in public/academic/special libraries, as related to https://doi.org/10.1108/LHT-11-2021-0378. These 5 projects were inspired by interviews with librarians about their use of single-board computers outside of the makerspace context. Many of these low-cost projects were used to directly solve problems or prototype solutions for library needs. The goal of this work is to provide documentation for projects similar to the ones discussed by the librarians we interviewed in an effort to make these solutions more accessible to the broader library community. These projects include: a digital signage display, gate counter, temperature monitor, OPAC station, and poem printer bot. 




To recreate these projects, you can git clone the entire repo:

`git clone https://github.com/prattpi/piprojects4libraries`

Then go into the project folder you want to recreate and follow that ReadMe for further instruction.
